DuneCon,A day of Wizards and the wonders of blockchain data,"We’ll have a series of activities throughout the day, from hackathons & talks to training sessions and fun events.

Then we’ll wrap things up by around 18:30 before heading over to an evening venue for more socializing and merriment into the night!

This is first and foremost a Wizard event. We want to say thank you and give everybody a great day while getting to know our community better. But DuneCon is also open to prospective Wizards, partners, and industry guests.

The day is going to be a lively combination of learning, networking, socializing, and celebrating - we're going to make it a day to remember.",9/15/2022,8:00:00 AM,9/15/2022,6:30:00 PM,Funkhaus,"Nalepastraße 18, 12459 Berlin",https://www.dunecon.com/,conference
