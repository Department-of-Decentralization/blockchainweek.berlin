A new ground floor for finance and government has arrived. Bits and bytes do not care about flesh and blood. We create them, and they work for us. Whether we use them to build a world that works for us, or a world that we work for, will be decided in the coming decades. Join us at OpenQ localhost:berlin, an interactive symposium and hackathon at the intersection of blockchain, futurology, and policy.",9/13/2022,2:00:00 PM,9/13/2022,10:00:00 PM,Nest3,Leibnizstraße 73,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/openq-localhostberlin-interactive-web3-symposium-and-hackathon-tickets-410069237127,hackathon
Cross Chain Product & Developer Workshop (Polkadot & Kusama),"Calling all Polkadot users and enthusiasts! What are the challenges to build cross chain composability in Polkadot?

Parachains in the Polkadot ecosystem are opting to build its cross-chain interoperable solution on Polkadot largely due to its parachain offering. Polkadot parachains are a series of small, application-specific chains connecting to Polkadot’s central governance chain, the relay chain. With Polkadot’s XCM (cross-consensus messaging), a new standard is emerging: one that puts security at the top of the agenda, but without compromising on the importance of making the process seamless and user-friendly. Although there is an incredible degree of flexibility, making this an optimal place for each project to build, there are challenges coming up along the way that we want to solve together. 

Learn from the Polkadot community about cross chain experiments, challenges, best practices, and plans for the future. Come with your key challenges and together we'll work on solutions.","Unlocking true cross chain interoperability About this event Calling all substrate users and enthusiasts! With Polkadot’s XCM (cross-consensus messaging), a new standard is emerging: one that puts security at the top of the agenda, but without compromising on the importance of making the process seamless and user-friendly. The first functional iteration of XCM was rolled out in May, allowing parachain partners within Polkadot and Kusama to open up channels and transfer data between each other. Many of these parachains are already preparing for a new era of interoperability by designing innovative new cross-chain applications and services. Learn from the Substrate community about cross chain experiments, best practices, and plans for the future. Bring with your key challenges and together we'll work on solutions. This workshop will provide the latest insights into Substrate and its cross-chain applications, the future of the ecosystem, improved technical skills of participants and inspire participants by connecting with like-minded Web3 builders.",9/13/2022,1:00:00 PM,9/13/2022,4:00:00 PM,Centrifuge Office,"Glogauer Straße 6, 2nd backyard, 10999 Berlin",https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cross-chain-product-developer-workshop-polkadot-kusama-tickets-411159056807,workshop
Breaking Digital Borders: Scaling User-Owned Data from Zero to One Million,"In this event, Affinidi will host a talk and demo by multidisciplinary tech leaders who will touch upon what’s lies beyond Web 3 for unlocking data, scaling from zero to one million user-owned data through a real-world use case (Common Check), and challenges and opportunities for achieving scalability from a business and ecosystem standpoint for an open, trusted data ecosystem.

COMSOC - DAO Voting Mechanisms,"Computational Social Choice (COMSOC) deals with designing and analysing algorithmic and game-theoretic principles that are applicable for making community decisions that respect the preferences of the community members. Such algorithms are crucial in crypto both for selecting a validator committee and reaching a voting-based consensus, and governance-level operations such as changing a protocol or deciding on how to use a DAO treasury.",Join us for a session about DAO selection and voting mechanisms.,9/14/2022,10:00:00 AM,9/14/2022,11:30:00 AM,Full Node Berlin,"Skalitzer Strasse 85-86, 10997 Berlin, Germany",https://tokenengineeringcommunity.github.io/website/docs/academy-welcome/#token-engineering-berlinblockchainweek-2022-bbw2022,workshop
